//   Idle      -> increment backoff counter, apply spin/yield/sleep policy.
//   Blocked   -> output queue was full; do NOT pop input on the next tick()
//               (the operator must remember the un-pushed event internally).
//               Increment backoff counter to give the downstream time to drain.

// ── IOperator ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The abstract base class for every operator in the pipeline.
//
// Lifecycle:
//   1. Construct the operator (pass queue pointers, lambda, etc. in ctor).
//   2. Runtime calls init() once on the owning thread before the first tick().
//   3. Runtime calls tick() in a tight loop for the operator's lifetime.
//   4. Runtime calls shutdown() once when stopping (after setting stop flag).
//
// Threading: init(), tick(), and shutdown() are always called from the same
// worker thread. The operator does not need to protect its own state with
// locks — the queues are the synchronisation boundary.
//
// The operator OWNS a "pending" slot: when tick() returns Blocked, it means
// the operator has popped an event from its input queue and stored it in an
// internal field (e.g., `pending_`). On the next tick() call, it attempts
// to push the pending event again without popping a new one. This guarantees
// at-most-once-pop: we never lose data by popping something we could not push.
